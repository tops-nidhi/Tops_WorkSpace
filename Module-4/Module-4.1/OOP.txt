      a.Overloading
          I.Function Overloading
          ->Same name of Function, Same class but different parameter.
          II.Operator Overloading(using Operator keyword)
      b.Overriding
          I.Function Overriding
          ->Same name of Function, Same parameter but different class.

  ii.Run Time
      a.Virtual
